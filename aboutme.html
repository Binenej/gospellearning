            <p>I’m Jonathan Binene, I’m from the Democratic Republic of Congo. I’m a disciple of Jesus Christ and, a member of the church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. I grew up in the church, so that means I grew up believing that I have Heavenly parents and that Jesus Christ is my savior. I grew up seeing how the gospel became such a huge blessing to me and the people around me. The blessings of the gospel in my life and the lives of the people around me led me to a decision to go serve and preach the gospel to as many people as I could. I served my mission in the Ghana Kumasi and the Abidjan West Mission, both missions in West Africa. During my two-year mission, I met thousands of people from different dominions who taught me to believe in God and how to be a good religious boy. I am grateful for all the people that I met and for what I got to learn from them. Serving a two-year mission changed my life forever. Since my mission, I have had a desire to always share the gospel, and this is the main reason for this website and the upcoming podcast. I have come to know the Savoir personally and developed a desire to always share something about Him</p>
