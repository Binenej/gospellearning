      <h3>Page d'accueil</h3>
      <p>Jesus Christ and His gospel have been at the center of my life. I have tasted His goodness and love in my life and have come to know that he is the source of all happiness. The gospel has been the source of inspiration, fear of evildoing, belief in a higher power, and hope for a future better life. This website will be a place where the gospel, testimonies, and experiences from people who have been living the gospel will be shared. It will be the place where religious people can see how other religious people like them live and experience the gospel in their everyday lives. This website will contain most of the gospel research that will be shared on the podcast channel and its references. It will be the place where I will share most of my insights about the gospel and how it is a blessing to me. Through this website, you will be on a gospel journey with me as we grow together in a better understanding of Christ and His gospel. </p>

      <h3>À propos de moi</h3>
      <p>I’m Jonathan Binene, I’m from the Democratic Republic of Congo. I’m a disciple of Jesus Christ and, a member of the church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. I grew up in the church, so that means I grew up believing that I have Heavenly parents and that Jesus Christ is my savior. I grew up seeing how the gospel became such a huge blessing to me and the people around me. The blessings of the gospel in my life and the lives of the people around me led me to a decision to go serve and preach the gospel to as many people as I could. I served my mission in the Ghana Kumasi and the Abidjan West Mission, both missions in West Africa. During my two-year mission, I met thousands of people from different dominions who taught me to believe in God and how to be a good religious boy. I am grateful for all the people that I met and for what I got to learn from them. Serving a two-year mission changed my life forever. Since my mission, I have had a desire to always share the gospel, and this is the main reason for this website and the upcoming podcast. I have come to know the Savoir personally and developed a desire to always share something about Him</p>

      </ul>
      <h3>Les Écritures</h3>
      <p>Scriptures are the road map for me and many other people throughout the world from different dominions. If there is something on which every religion can agree on is that every religion is built on a set of scriptures considered to be sacred to the believers. I personally believe in the Bible, the Book of Mormon, the Doctrines and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price to be sacred scriptures. I have come to love reading from these scripture books as they always uplift me and help me to become a better person. During my mission, I developed a strong love for scriptures and what they contain as messages of hope and belief. I refer to the scriptures as a road map because they have been guiding me since I started reading them and they never led me or people that I know astray. I consider them to be the best map on which a human being can solely rely.</p>
